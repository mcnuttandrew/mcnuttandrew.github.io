While current file-management interfaces help users retrieve files in disorganized repositories, they do not aid in organization. Pertinent files can be difficult to find, and files that should have been deleted may remain. To help, we designed KondoCloud, a file-browser interface for personal cloud storage. KondoCloud makes machine learning-based recommendations of files users may want to retrieve, move, or delete. These recommendations leverage the intuition that similar files should be managed similarly.<br/><br/>We developed and evaluated KondoCloud through two complementary online user studies. In our Observation Study, we logged the actions of 69 participants who spent 30 minutes manually organizing their own Google Drive repositories. We identified high-level organizational strategies, including moving related files to newly created sub-folders and extensively deleting files. To train the classifiers that underpin KondoCloud's recommendations, we had participants label whether pairs of files were similar and whether they should be managed similarly. In addition, we extracted ten metadata and content features from all files in participants' repositories. Our logistic regression classifiers all achieved F1 scores of 0.72 or higher. In our Evaluation Study, 62 participants used KondoCloud either with or without recommendations. Roughly half of participants accepted a non-trivial fraction of recommendations, and some participants accepted nearly all of them. Participants who were shown the recommendations were more likely to delete related files located in different directories. They also generally felt the recommendations improved efficiency. Participants who were not shown recommendations nonetheless manually performed about a third of the actions that would have been recommended.",bibTex:"TODO",type:"conference / journal articles",subtype:"conference"},{link:"https://www.mcnutt.in/zine-potential",urlTitle:"",imgLink:"converted-images/zine-potential.jpg",title:"On The Potential of Zines as a Medium for Visualization",authors:"Andrew McNutt",journal:"IEEE VIS Short Papers",date:"October 2021",links:[{name:"about",link:"https://www.mcnutt.in/zine-potential"},{name:"preprint",link:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02177"}],abstract:"Zines are a form of small-circulation self-produced publication often akin to a magazine.

We exemplify the pliability of abstracting over charting grammars by implementing—as a template—the functionality of the shelf builder Polestar (a simulacra of Tableau) and a set of templates that emulate the Google Sheets chart chooser.

The programmatic evaluation model of visualization linting (or vis lint) offers a compelling framework for the automation of visualization guidelines, as it offers unambiguous feedback during the chart creation process, and can execute analyses derived from machine vision and natural language processing. We demonstrate the feasibility of this system through the production of vislint_mpl, a prototype visualization linting system, that evaluates charts created in matplotlib.",bibTex:"\n    @misc{mcnuttKindlmannLinting,\n      Author = {McNutt, Andrew and Kindlmann, Gordon},\n      Howpublished = {IEEE VIS Workshop: href{https://c4pgv.dbvis.de/}{VisGuides: 2nd Workshop on the Creation, Curation, Critique and Conditioning of Principles and Guidelines in Visualization}},\n      Month = oct,\n      Title = {Linting for Visualization: Towards a Practical Automated Visualization Guidance System},\n      Year = {2018}}\n    ",type:"extended abstract / workshop papers",subtype:"workshop"},{link:"https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7724-6_14",imgLink:"converted-images/cdd-pic.jpg",urlTitle:"reporter-assays",title:"Data Mining and Computational Modeling of High-Throughput Screening Datasets",authors:"Sean Ekins, Alex M.

The growth of academic HTS screening centers and the increasing move to academia for early stage drug discovery suggests a great need for the informatics tools and methods to mine such data and learn from it. Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) has developed a number of tools for storing, mining, securely and selectively sharing, as well as learning from such HTS data. We present a new web based data mining and visualization module directly within the CDD Vault platform for high-throughput drug discovery data that makes use of a novel technology stack following modern reactive design principles. We also describe CDD Models within the CDD Vault platform that enables researchers to share models, share predictions from models, and create models from distributed, heterogeneous data. Our system is built on top of the Collaborative Drug Discovery Vault Activity and Registration data repository ecosystem which allows users to manipulate and visualize thousands of molecules in real time. This can be performed in any browser on any platform. In this chapter we present examples of its use with public datasets in CDD Vault. Such approaches can complement other cheminformatics tools, whether open source or commercial, in providing approaches for data mining and modeling of HTS data.",type:"theses / book chapters",subtype:"chapter"},{link:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07537",imgLink:"converted-images/qgrav-pic.jpg",title:"The Schrodinger-Newton System with Self-field Coupling",authors:"Joel Franklin, Youdan Guo, Andrew McNutt, Allison Morgan",urlTitle:"qgrav",journal:"Journal of Classical and Quantum Gravity",date:"2015",links:[{name:"paper",link:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07537"},{name:"slides",link:"assets/QGravPresentation.pdf"}],abstract:"We study the Schrodinger-Newton system of equations with the addition of gravitational field energy sourcing - such additional nonlinearity is to be expected from a theory of gravity (like general relativity), and its appearance in this simplified scalar setting (one of Einstein's precursors to general relativity) leads to significant changes in the spectrum of the self-gravitating theory. Using an iterative technique, we compare the mass dependence of the ground state energies of both Schrodinger-Newton and the new, self-sourced system and find that they are dramatically different. The Bohr method approach from old quantization provides a qualitative description of the difference, which comes from the additional nonlinearity introduced in the self-sourced case. In addition to comparison of ground state energies, we calculate the transition energy between the ground state and first excited state to compare emission frequencies between Schrodinger-Newton and the self-coupled scalar case.",type:"conference / journal articles",subtype:"journal"},{link:"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00143",imgLink:"converted-images/cdd-models-pic.jpg",title:"Open source Bayesian models. 1.

Public accessibility is also an issue with computational models for bioactivity, and the ability to share such models still remains a major challenge limiting drug discovery. We describe the creation of a reference implementation of a Bayesian model-building software module, which we have released as an open source component that is now included in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) project, as well as implemented in the CDD Vault and in several mobile apps. We use this implementation to build an array of Bayesian models for ADME/Tox, in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, and other physicochemical properties. We show that these models possess cross-validation receiver operator curve values comparable to those generated previously in prior publications using alternative tools. We have now described how the implementation of Bayesian models with FCFP6 descriptors generated in the CDD Vault enables the rapid production of robust machine learning models from public data or the user’s own datasets. The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.",type:"conference / journal articles",subtype:"journal"},{link:"assets/thesis.pdf",imgLink:"converted-images/thesis-pic.jpg",title:"Nonequivalent Lagrangian Mechanics",urlTitle:"nonequiv",authors:"Andrew McNutt (Advised by Nelia Mann)",journal:"Undergraduate thesis.
