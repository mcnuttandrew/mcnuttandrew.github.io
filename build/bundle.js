Using an iterative technique,\n    we compare the mass dependence of the ground state energies of both Schrodinger-Newton\n    and the new, self-sourced system and find that they are dramatically different.\n    The Bohr method approach from old quantization provides a qualitative description of\n    the difference, which comes from the additional nonlinearity introduced in the self-sourced\n    case. In addition to comparison of ground state energies, we calculate the transition\n    energy between the ground state and first excited state to compare emission frequencies\n    between Schrodinger-Newton and the self-coupled scalar case.\n    ",type:"conference / journal articles"},{link:"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00143",imgLink:"converted-images/cdd-models-pic.jpg",title:"Open source Bayesian models. 1.

We describe the creation of a reference implementation of a Bayesian\n    model-building software module, which we have released as an open source component\n    that is now included in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) project, as well as\n    implemented in the CDD Vault and in several mobile apps. We use this implementation\n    to build an array of Bayesian models for ADME/Tox, in vitro and in vivo bioactivity,\n    and other physicochemical properties. We show that these models possess cross-validation\n    receiver operator curve values comparable to those generated previously in prior\n    publications using alternative tools. We have now described how the implementation\n    of Bayesian models with FCFP6 descriptors generated in the CDD Vault enables the\n    rapid production of robust machine learning models from public data or the user’s\n    own datasets. The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary\n    software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in\n    open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can\n    enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.",type:"conference / journal articles"},{link:"assets/thesis.pdf",imgLink:"converted-images/thesis-pic.jpg",title:"Nonequivalent Lagrangian Mechanics",urlTitle:"nonequiv",authors:"Andrew McNutt (Advised by Nelia Mann)",journal:"Undergraduate thesis.
