The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary\n    software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in\n    open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can\n    enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.",type:"conference / journal articles"},{link:"assets/thesis.pdf",imgLink:"converted-images/thesis-pic.jpg",title:"Nonequivalent Lagrangian Mechanics",urlTitle:"nonequiv",authors:"Andrew McNutt (Advised by Nelia Mann)",journal:"Undergraduate thesis.

In every case that\n    we examine, these invariants turn out to be Noetherian invariants in disguise. We\n    apply this theory to a wide variety of systems including predator-prey dynamics and\n    damped driven harmonic motion.",type:"theses"}],ue=[{imgLink:"converted-images/design-patterns-pic.jpg",title:"Design Patterns For Data Visualization in React",link:"http://tinyurl.com/reactvisdesignpatterns",journal:"React Chicago.
