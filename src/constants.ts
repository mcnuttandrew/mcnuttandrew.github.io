      'Visualization has long been seen as a dependable and trustworthy tool for carrying out analysis and communication tasks -- a view reinforced by the growing interest in applying it to socially positive ends. However, despite the benign light in which visualization is usually perceived, it carries the potential to do harm to people, places, concepts, and things. In this paper, we capitalize on this negative potential to serve an underrepresented (but technologically engaged) group: villains. To achieve these ends, we introduce a design space for this type of graphical violence, which allows us to unify prior work on deceptive visualization with novel data-driven dastardly deeds, such as emotional spear phishing and unsafe data physicalization. By charting this vile charting landscape, we open new doors to collaboration with terrifying domain experts, and hopefully, make the world just a bit worse.',

      "Users face many challenges in keeping their personal file collections organized. While current file-management interfaces help users retrieve files in disorganized repositories, they do not aid in organization. Pertinent files can be difficult to find, and files that should have been deleted may remain. To help, we designed KondoCloud, a file-browser interface for personal cloud storage. KondoCloud makes machine learning-based recommendations of files users may want to retrieve, move, or delete. These recommendations leverage the intuition that similar files should be managed similarly.<br/><br/>We developed and evaluated KondoCloud through two complementary online user studies. In our Observation Study, we logged the actions of 69 participants who spent 30 minutes manually organizing their own Google Drive repositories. We identified high-level organizational strategies, including moving related files to newly created sub-folders and extensively deleting files. To train the classifiers that underpin KondoCloud's recommendations, we had participants label whether pairs of files were similar and whether they should be managed similarly. In addition, we extracted ten metadata and content features from all files in participants' repositories. Our logistic regression classifiers all achieved F1 scores of 0.72 or higher. In our Evaluation Study, 62 participants used KondoCloud either with or without recommendations. Roughly half of participants accepted a non-trivial fraction of recommendations, and some participants accepted nearly all of them. Participants who were shown the recommendations were more likely to delete related files located in different directories. They also generally felt the recommendations improved efficiency. Participants who were not shown recommendations nonetheless manually performed about a third of the actions that would have been recommended.",

This free-form medium has a long history and has been used as means for personal or intimate expression, as a way for marginalized people to describe issues that are important to them, and as a venue for graphical experimentation. It would seem then that zines would make an ideal vehicle for the recent interest in applying feminist or humanist ideas to visualization. Yet, there has been little work combining visualization and zines. In this paper we explore the potential of this intersection by analyzing examples of zines that use data graphics and by describing the pedagogical value that they can have in a visualization classroom. In doing so, we argue that there are plentiful opportunities for visualization research and practice in this rich intersectional-medium.',

While such forms can be intriguing, it can be unclear how to make effective use of them without long periods of practice or costly user studies. In this work we analyze the table cartogram‚Äîa graphic which visualizes tabular data by bringing the areas of a grid of quadrilaterals into correspondence with the input data, like a heat map that has been *area-ed* rather than colored. Despite having existed for several years, little is known about its appropriate usage. We mend this gap by using Algebraic Visualization Design to show that they are best suited to relatively small tables with ordinal axes for some comparison and outlier identification tasks. In doing so we demonstrate a discount theory-based analysis that can be used to cheaply determine best practices for unknown visualizations.

Interfaces for creating visualizations typically embrace one of several common forms. Textual specification enables fine-grained control, shelf building facilitates rapid exploration, while chart choosing promotes immediacy and simplicity. Ideally these approaches could be unified to integrate the user- and usage-dependent benefits found in each modality, yet these forms remain distinct.

<br />
We propose parameterized declarative templates, a simple abstraction mechanism over JSON-based visualization grammars, as a foundation for multimodal visualization editors. We demonstrate how templates can facilitate organization and reuse by factoring the more than 160 charts that constitute Vega-Lite's example gallery into approximately 40 templates. We exemplify the pliability of abstracting over charting grammars by implementing‚Äîas a template‚Äîthe functionality of the shelf builder Polestar (a simulacra of Tableau) and a set of templates that emulate the Google Sheets chart chooser. We show how templates support multimodal visualization editing by implementing a prototype and evaluating it through an approachability study.`,

While these methods have been applied effectively to a variety of types of texts and contexts, they can leave unaddressed the needs of scholars in the humanities disciplines like history, who often engage in close reading of sources. Complementing the close analysis of texts with some of the tools of distant reading, such as visualization, can resolve some of the issues. We focus on a particular category of this intersection‚Äîwhich we refer to as near-by reading‚Äîwherein an expert engages in a computer-mediated analysis of a text with which they are familiar. We provide an example of this approach by developing a visual analysis application for the near-by reading of 19th-century scientific writings by J. W. von Goethe and A. P. de Candolle. We show that even the most formal and public texts, such as scientific treatises, can reveal unexpressed personal biases and philosophies that the authors themselves might not have recognized.',

We adapt a methodology from software testing, metamorphic testing, as a way of automatically surfacing potential mirages at the visual encoding stage of analysis through modifications to the underlying data and chart specification. We show that metamorphic testing can reliably identify mirages across a variety of chart types with relatively little prior knowledge of the data or the domain.',

      ' Constructing effective charts and graphs in a scientific setting is a nuanced task that requires a thorough understanding of visualization design; a knowledge that may not be available to all practicing scientists. Previous attempts to address this problem have pushed chart creators to pore over large collections of guidelines and heuristics, or to relegate their entire workflow to end-to-end tools that provide automated recommendations. In this paper we bring together these two strains of ideas by introducing the use of lint as a mechanism for guiding chart creators towards effective visualizations in a manner that can be configured to taste and task without forcing users to abandon their usual workflows. The programmatic evaluation model of visualization linting (or vis lint) offers a compelling framework for the automation of visualization guidelines, as it offers unambiguous feedback during the chart creation process, and can execute analyses derived from machine vision and natural language processing. We demonstrate the feasibility of this system through the production of vislint_mpl, a prototype visualization linting system, that evaluates charts created in matplotlib.',

Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) has developed a number of tools for storing, mining, securely and selectively sharing, as well as learning from such HTS data. We present a new web based data mining and visualization module directly within the CDD Vault platform for high-throughput drug discovery data that makes use of a novel technology stack following modern reactive design principles. We also describe CDD Models within the CDD Vault platform that enables researchers to share models, share predictions from models, and create models from distributed, heterogeneous data. Our system is built on top of the Collaborative Drug Discovery Vault Activity and Registration data repository ecosystem which allows users to manipulate and visualize thousands of molecules in real time. This can be performed in any browser on any platform. In this chapter we present examples of its use with public datasets in CDD Vault. Such approaches can complement other cheminformatics tools, whether open source or commercial, in providing approaches for data mining and modeling of HTS data.',

      "We study the Schrodinger-Newton system of equations with the addition of gravitational field energy sourcing - such additional nonlinearity is to be expected from a theory of gravity (like general relativity), and its appearance in this simplified scalar setting (one of Einstein's precursors to general relativity) leads to significant changes in the spectrum of the self-gravitating theory. Using an iterative technique, we compare the mass dependence of the ground state energies of both Schrodinger-Newton and the new, self-sourced system and find that they are dramatically different. The Bohr method approach from old quantization provides a qualitative description of the difference, which comes from the additional nonlinearity introduced in the self-sourced case. In addition to comparison of ground state energies, we calculate the transition energy between the ground state and first excited state to compare emission frequencies between Schrodinger-Newton and the self-coupled scalar case.",

    abstract:
      'On the order of hundreds of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) models have been described in the literature in the past decade which are more often than not inaccessible to anyone but their authors. Public accessibility is also an issue with computational models for bioactivity, and the ability to share such models still remains a major challenge limiting drug discovery. We describe the creation of a reference implementation of a Bayesian model-building software module, which we have released as an open source component that is now included in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) project, as well as implemented in the CDD Vault and in several mobile apps. We use this implementation to build an array of Bayesian models for ADME/Tox, in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, and other physicochemical properties. We show that these models possess cross-validation receiver operator curve values comparable to those generated previously in prior publications using alternative tools. We have now described how the implementation of Bayesian models with FCFP6 descriptors generated in the CDD Vault enables the rapid production of robust machine learning models from public data or the user‚Äôs own datasets. The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.',

    In this thesis we study a modern formalism known as Nonequivalent Lagrangian
    Mechanics, that is constructed on top of the traditional Lagrangian theory of mechanics.
    By making use of the non-uniqueness of the Lagrangian representation of dynamical
    systems, we are able to generate conservation laws in a way that is novel and, in
    many cases much faster than the traditional Noetherian analysis. In every case that
    we examine, these invariants turn out to be Noetherian invariants in disguise. We
    apply this theory to a wide variety of systems including predator-prey dynamics and
    damped driven harmonic motion.`,
