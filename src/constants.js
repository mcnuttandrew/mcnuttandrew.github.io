  I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My work focuses on
  information visualization generally. More specifically I'm interested in
  automated guidance systems, unusual or xenographical data visualizations,
  and web applications as a medium for novel experiences. I'm advised by Gordon Kindlmann.
  `;

export const HISTORY = `
  In the very near past I worked as a Data Visualization Engineer for a variety of
  companies in San Francisco, where I made visual analytic software.
  I got a formal education in physics from Reed College in Portland, and an informal
  education in web development from App Academy in San Francisco. I really like deserts,
  buffalo, and motorcycles. Edward Tufte once made fun of me in a hotel in Seattle.

    Constructing effective charts and graphs in a scientific setting is a
    nuanced task that requires a thorough understanding of visualization
    design; a knowledge that may not be available to all practicing scientists.
    Previous attempts to address this problem have pushed chart
    creators to pore over large collections of guidelines and heuristics,
    or to relegate their entire workflow to end-to-end tools that provide
    automated recommendations. In this paper we bring together these
    two strains of ideas by introducing the use of lint as a mechanism for
    guiding chart creators towards effective visualizations in a manner
    that can be configured to taste and task without forcing users to abandon their usual workflows.
    The programmatic evaluation model of
    visualization linting (or vis lint) offers a compelling framework for
    the automation of visualization guidelines, as it offers unambiguous
    feedback during the chart creation process, and can execute analyses derived from machine vision and natural language processing.
    We demonstrate the feasibility of this system through the production of vislint_mpl,
    a prototype visualization linting system, that
    evaluates charts created in matplotlib.

    We are now seeing the benefit of investments made over the last decade in
    high-throughput screening (HTS) that is resulting in large structure activity
    datasets entering public and open databases such as ChEMBL and PubChem.
    The growth of academic HTS screening centers and the increasing move to academia
    for early stage drug discovery suggests a great need for the informatics tools and
    methods to mine such data and learn from it. Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD)
    has developed a number of tools for storing, mining, securely and selectively sharing,
    as well as learning from such HTS data. We present a new web based data mining and
    visualization module directly within the CDD Vault platform for high-throughput
    drug discovery data that makes use of a novel technology stack following modern
    reactive design principles. We also describe CDD Models within the CDD Vault platform
    that enables researchers to share models, share predictions from models, and create models
    from distributed, heterogeneous data. Our system is built on top of the Collaborative
    Drug Discovery Vault Activity and Registration data repository ecosystem which allows
    users to manipulate and visualize thousands of molecules in real time. This can be
    performed in any browser on any platform. In this chapter we present examples of its
    use with public datasets in CDD Vault. Such approaches can complement other cheminformatics
    tools, whether open source or commercial, in providing approaches for data mining and modeling of HTS data.

    We study the Schrodinger-Newton system of equations with the addition of gravitational
    field energy sourcing - such additional nonlinearity is to be expected from a theory
    of gravity (like general relativity), and its appearance in this simplified scalar
    setting (one of Einstein's precursors to general relativity) leads to significant
    changes in the spectrum of the self-gravitating theory. Using an iterative technique,
    we compare the mass dependence of the ground state energies of both Schrodinger-Newton
    and the new, self-sourced system and find that they are dramatically different.
    The Bohr method approach from old quantization provides a qualitative description of
    the difference, which comes from the additional nonlinearity introduced in the self-sourced
    case. In addition to comparison of ground state energies, we calculate the transition
    energy between the ground state and first excited state to compare emission frequencies
    between Schrodinger-Newton and the self-coupled scalar case.

    On the order of hundreds of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,
    and toxicity (ADME/Tox) models have been described in the literature in the
    past decade which are more often than not inaccessible to anyone but their authors.
    Public accessibility is also an issue with computational models for bioactivity,
    and the ability to share such models still remains a major challenge limiting drug
    discovery. We describe the creation of a reference implementation of a Bayesian
    model-building software module, which we have released as an open source component
    that is now included in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) project, as well as
    implemented in the CDD Vault and in several mobile apps. We use this implementation
    to build an array of Bayesian models for ADME/Tox, in vitro and in vivo bioactivity,
    and other physicochemical properties. We show that these models possess cross-validation
    receiver operator curve values comparable to those generated previously in prior
    publications using alternative tools. We have now described how the implementation
    of Bayesian models with FCFP6 descriptors generated in the CDD Vault enables the
    rapid production of robust machine learning models from public data or the userâ€™s
    own datasets. The current study sets the stage for generating models in proprietary
    software (such as CDD) and exporting these models in a format that could be run in
    open source software using CDK components. This work also demonstrates that we can
    enable biocomputation across distributed private or public datasets to enhance drug discovery.`

    In this thesis we study a modern formalism known as Nonequivalent Lagrangian

    By making use of the non-uniqueness of the Lagrangian representation of dynamical
    systems, we are able to generate conservation laws in a way that is novel and, in
    many cases much faster than the traditional Noetherian analysis. In every case that
    we examine, these invariants turn out to be Noetherian invariants in disguise. We
    apply this theory to a wide variety of systems including predator-prey dynamics and
    damped driven harmonic motion.`
