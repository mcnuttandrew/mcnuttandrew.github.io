**Hiring 2024**

I'm hiring 1-2 Ph.D. students to start at University of Utah in Fall 2025. There's lots you can read about why working at Utah is great---for instance the nearness to the mountains and canyons, as well as the unmatched visualization community (which is, debatably, [top 1 in the US](https://csrankings.org/index?visualization&us#/index?visualization&us)) is what drew me here. The point of this ad is to tell you a bit about what I'm looking for in a student; to tell you about the working context rather than its environment.

I'm looking for students who are interested in some combination of HCI, Vis, or Programming Interfaces.

Some of my main approaches to research involve system design and prototyping, theory/critical reflection, and qualitative analysis. It is a strong signal to me if you have experience in one of these areas and can show it in some way that matters to you.
For instance, if you aspire to build things, having built something you care about is a great way to show that. I love to see cool things people have made.
Not every interest or approach matches perfectly with making demos, for instance, having thought carefully about the context and usage of a particular system won't necessarily yield a pretty picture. But reifying that critical thinking as an essay, blog post, or other writing, is a strong signal. When considering a phd it is good, and possibly even essential, to care about something and have a means showing it.

There are many types of people who apply for Ph.D. programs for a wide range of reasons. I'm excited to work with a diverse group of students, but more than that I'm interested in working with interested and engaged people.
There's lots of ways to show that you're interested and engaged, and I'm interested in seeing them.
For instance, people who have been through the US community college system is a very strong signal of interest (and drive) to me, as is taking non-traditional paths to grad school (such as through industry).
Another is having read some of the papers in the field that you are interested in and having thought carefully about them.
Another, per the above, is having some way of showing that you care about something.
Everyone's path is different, and I'm delighted to work with lots of different people.

If you're interested in working with me, please apply to the [University of Utah's Ph.D. program in Computer Science](https://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions/graduate-application/) and mention me in your application. (The deadline is in early December). There are wonderful things to build and think about, and I'm excited to work with you on them.

**FAQ**

_Can I do ML/AI/etc work with you?_ While my work sometimes touches AI or AI-ish topics, it is not generally a subject I study. If your interests are primarily in AI/ML, I'm not the right advisor for you and you should look elsewhere.

_Are you hiring interns (or another non-phd position)?_ I am only hiring Ph.D. students at this time.

_Do I need to email you before applying?_ nope! you dont need anyone's permission to apply. Just mention me in your statement and thatll set the wheels in motion.
