I'm an incoming assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah in the School of Computing + Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. My work falls in the intersection of Data Visualization and HCI. 

<br/>

I'm interested in theories of visualization (and finding opportunities for the operationalization of those ideas), as well as the design of user interfaces for knowledge-based tasks (such as visual analytics and creative coding) with an eye towards leveraging tools from programming languages and software engineering in those designs.  I'm advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/).

<br/>
In the near past I worked as a data visualization engineer for a variety of companies in San Francisco. 
Before that I majored in physics at Reed College in Portland. 
I am a fan of deserts, <a href="https://www.mcnutt.in/#/zines">zines</a>, buffalo, and bicycles.
