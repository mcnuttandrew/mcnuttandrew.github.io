I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My work falls in the intersection of Data Visualization and HCI. 

<br/>

I'm interested in theories of visualization (and finding opportunities for the operationalization of those ideas), as well as the design of user interfaces for knowledge-based tasks (such as visual analytics and creative coding) with an eye towards leveraging tools from programming languages and software engineering in those designs.  I'm advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/).

<br/>
In the near past I worked as a data visualization engineer for a variety of companies in San Francisco. 
Before that I majored in physics at Reed College in Portland. 
I am a fan of deserts, zines, buffalo, and bicycles.

I'm currently on the academic job market looking for assistant professor and post doc roles in North America. If any of these (research) topics are of interest, please drop me a line by email (mcnutt AT uchicago DOT edu) or on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/_mcnutt_/">@_mcnutt_</a>).
