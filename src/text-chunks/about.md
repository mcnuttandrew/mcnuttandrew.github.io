I'm a Post Doc at University of Washington with the [Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/). I am also an incoming assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah in the [School of Computing and Imaging](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) Institute (SCI). I recently graduated from UChicago CS where I was advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/). During my Ph.D. I was lucky to intern at Tableau Research and Microsoft Research. 

<br/>

I'm interested in visualization systems and theories (such as grammars/DSLs, dashboards, and understanding what it means for a visualization to be "good") and the design of programming interfaces (such as for notebook programming, spreadsheet analysis, and creative coding). If you are interested in working with me (such as by being a PhD student at the University of Utah) please reach out (amcnutt at uw dot edu)! I'm looking for students for students starting the 2024-25 school year.

In the past I worked as a data visualization engineer for a variety of companies in San Francisco (including Uber and Collabortive Drug Discovery). 
Before that I majored in physics at Reed College. 
I am a fan of deserts, <a href="https://www.mcnutt.in/#/zines">zines</a>, buffalo, and bicycles.
