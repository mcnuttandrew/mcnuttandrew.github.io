I'm an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah in the [Scientific Computing and Imaging](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) Institute (SCI) and [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). Most recently I was a Post Doc at University of Washington with the [Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/), before that I did my Ph.D. at [UChicago CS](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) where I was advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/). During my Ph.D. I was lucky to intern at [Tableau Research](https://www.tableau.com/research) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/vida/), as well as to receive a [Siebel Scholarship](https://www.siebelscholars.com/scholar-profile/3717/).

I'm interested in Human Computer Interaction and Visualization, and Programming Interfaces. More specifically, I care about visualization systems (as in grammars/DSLs and linters), the design of interfaces for programming (e.g., notebooks and creative coding type interfaces), visualization theories (such as understanding what it means for a visualization or tool to be "good"), and taking critical perspective therein. Connecting these domains is an interest in "polite" systems, that is tools that support complex assistance while still allowing you to maintain agency.
More broadly, I am a fan of deserts, [zines](https://www.mcnutt.in/#/zines), and bicycles.
