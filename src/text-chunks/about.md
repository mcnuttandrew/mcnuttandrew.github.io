I'm an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah in the [Scientific Computing and Imaging](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) Institute (SCI) and [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). Most recently I was a Post Doc at University of Washington with the [Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/), before that I did my Ph.D. at [UChicago CS](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) where I was advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/). During my Ph.D. I was lucky to intern at [Tableau Research](https://www.tableau.com/research) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/vida/), as well as to receive a [Siebel Scholarship](https://www.siebelscholars.com/scholar-profile/3717/).

I'm interested in Human Computer Interaction and Visualization, and Programming Interfaces. More specifically, I like

- **Visualization systems**: Building grammars, domain-specific languages, and linters for vis and vis adjacent topics
- **Interfaces for programming**: Improving how we interact with code
- **Visualization theories**: Forming structures to answer questions like what does it mean for a visualization or tool to be "good"
- **Critical/sociotechnical perspectives**: Consider questions of context and situatedness

Connecting these domains is an interest in "polite" systems, that is tools that support complex assistance while still allowing you to maintain agency.
More broadly, I am a fan of deserts, [zines](https://www.mcnutt.in/#/zines), and bicycles.
