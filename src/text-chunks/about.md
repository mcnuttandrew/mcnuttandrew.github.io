I'm a Post Doc at University of Washington with the [Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/). I am also an incoming assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah in the [Scientific Computing and Imaging](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) Institute (SCI) and [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I recently graduated from [UChicago CS](https://cs.uchicago.edu/) where I was advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/). During my Ph.D. I was lucky to intern at Tableau Research and Microsoft Research.

Broadly I'm interested in Human Computer Interaction, Visualization, and Programming Systems. More specifically, I care about visualization systems (as in grammars/DSLs and linters), the design of interfaces for programming (e.g., notebooks and creative coding type interfaces), visualization theories (such as understanding what it means for a visualization or tool to be "good"), and taking critical perspective therein. Connecting these domains is an interest in "polite" systems, that is tools that support complex assistance while still allowing you to maintain agency. If you are interested in working with me, or just chattin, please reach out (amcnutt at uw dot edu)!

In the past I worked as a data visualization engineer for a variety of companies in San Francisco.
Before that I majored in physics at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/physics/). 
I am a fan of deserts, [zines](https://www.mcnutt.in/#/zines), buffalo, and bicycles.
