I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago's department of computer science, where I'm advised by [Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/). I am also an incoming assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah in the School of Computing and Imaging Institute. 

<br/>

I'm interested in theories of visualization (and finding opportunities for the operationalization of those ideas) and the design of programming interfaces (such as visual analytics and creative coding).  

<br/>
In the past I worked as a data visualization engineer for a variety of companies in San Francisco. 
Before that I majored in physics at Reed College in Portland. 
I am a fan of deserts, <a href="https://www.mcnutt.in/#/zines">zines</a>, buffalo, and bicycles.
