<h3>PhD Student in Visualization</h3>
<p>
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My work falls in the intersection of the Data Visualization and HCI fields. I'm especially interested in theories of visualization (opportunities for the operationalization of those ideas), as well as the design of user interfaces for knowledge-based tasks (such as visual analytics or creative coding) and ways to leverage ideas from programming languages and software engineering in those designs.
